# Loan Approval Prediction Model 🏦🤖

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the approval status of loan applications based on several factors like income, education, loan amount, and more. The model uses a **Random Forest Classifier**, and the trained model is saved as a `model.pkl` file, which can later be used for prediction.

## Project Overview 📊

This project aims to predict whether a loan will be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on features like:

- Number of dependents
- Education level
- Self-employment status
- Loan amount and term
- CIBIL score
- Asset values (residential, commercial, luxury)

The model is trained on a dataset and stored in a **Pickle** file (`model.pkl`), which can be later loaded for making predictions.

## Features 🌟

- **Loan Approval Prediction**: Predicts loan status based on input features.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest model using the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance using confusion matrix and classification report.
- **Pickle Model**: Saves the trained model for future predictions.

## Requirements 📦

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning model training and evaluation.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Installation 🛠️

### Step 1: Clone the repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git
cd loan-approval-prediction
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have `requirements.txt`, install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Step 3: Prepare the dataset

Make sure you have the **`loan_approval_dataset.csv`** file in the root folder of the project.

### Step 4: Run the script to train the model

Execute the training script `train_model.py` to train the model and save it:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, convert categorical features to numeric).
3. Train the Random Forest model.
4. Save the trained model to **`model.pkl`**.

## Usage 📝

After running the training script, you can use the saved model (`model.pkl`) for making predictions on new loan applications.

Here’s how you can load the model and make predictions in your own Python code:

```python
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the trained model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Example input data (similar to the training features)
input_data = np.array([[2, 1, 0, 500000, 200000, 15, 750, 150000, 100000, 50000, 200000]])

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

# Print loan approval status
if prediction[0] == 1:
    print("Loan Approved ✅")
else:
    print("Loan Rejected ❌")
```

Replace the `input_data` array with new applicant data.

## Code Explanation 🧑‍💻

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is loaded using pandas and columns like `education`, `self_employed`, and `loan_status` are mapped to numeric values.
   - We drop the `loan_id` column since it's unnecessary for prediction.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The dataset is split into features (`X`) and target (`y`).
   - A **Random Forest classifier** is used to train the model on the training data.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model's accuracy and performance are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4. **Model Saving**:
   - After training, the model is saved as `model.pkl` using **pickle**.

## Model Evaluation 📊

After training, the model is evaluated using the test data. The output includes:

### Example Classification Report:
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.80      0.85      0.82       100
           1       0.87      0.82      0.85       100

    accuracy                           0.83       200
   macro avg       0.83      0.83      0.83       200
weighted avg       0.83      0.83      0.83       200
```

### Example Confusion Matrix:
```
[[85 15]
 [18 82]]
```

This helps assess the model’s ability to classify loan status correctly.
